Homework 8 
1. What are sessions and cookies? What do they do? 
Sessions and cookies are used to store user-based data in a web application. A session stores temporary data on the server, linked to a unique session ID, ensuring user data persists only while the user is active. A cookie is a small file stored in the user's browser that can persist beyond the session, allowing the website to remember user preferences and authentication data across visits.


2. What is SQL? MySQL? What are relational databases? 


SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used for managing databases. MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL for querying and managing data. A relational database organizes data into tables with relationships, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.


3. What is normalization in SQL? 


Normalization is a process in database design that organizes tables to minimize redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller related ones. It follows a set of rules (normal forms) to improve data integrity and efficiency​










4. What are primary and foreign keys? 


A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring no duplicate values. A foreign key is a field in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing relationships between tables and enforcing referential integrity​
